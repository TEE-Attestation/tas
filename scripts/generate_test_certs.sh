#
# This file is part of the TEE Attestation Service.
#
# This script generates self-signed certificates for local development and testing.
# It creates a simple CA and uses it to sign server and client certificates.
# The server certificate is created with Subject Alternative Names (SANs) for
# 'localhost' and '127.0.0.1' to prevent SSL verification errors.
# Usage:
#   bash generate_test_certs.sh
# The generated certificates will be placed in the ${CERT_DIR} directory.
# The script will overwrite any existing certificates in that directory.
# Prerequisites:
# - OpenSSL must be installed and available in the system PATH.
